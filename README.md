Sitecore 8.2 + Helix + Common Extensions and Patterns

Prerequisites:
Sitecore Instance Manager v8.2
Npm Installation on root source folder
Team Development for Sitecore (TDS) 
Integrated Dynamic Placeholders (can be found in the Sitecore MarketPlace)

FYI:
Since I'm not using Unicorn for deployment of serialzed Sitecore Items any TDS project
will be configured in Configuration Manager to not Build or Deploy (see blog for details)
