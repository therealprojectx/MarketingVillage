Prerequisites:

FYI:
Since I'm not using Unicorn for deployment of serialzed Sitecore Items any TDS project
will be configured in Configuration Manager to not Build or Deploy (see blog for details)


Design:

All components and renderings are based on the free bootstrap template
Modern Business
https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/modern-business/
This template provided some great components to begin for the general sandbox purpose of my point of views

I encourage anyone to fork it, own it, and continue to enhance it...I'll be doing the same.
